        <h2><b>ðŸ‘‰'C' Introduction</b></h2>     
    
          <p class="raj1">'c' language is a procedural programming language used to develop portable application software.It is very powerfull and flexible language.<br>
            It provides the programer a facility to write a low level programers as well as writing high level programes.'c' is called as a middle level language.<br>
            It permitts machine independent programs to written closed interaction with the hardware.<br>
            It introduced in (1972) by (Dennis Ritchie) at the Bell Telephone Laboratories,and was first use with the unix operating system.<br></p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2><b>ðŸ‘‰History</b></h2>
            <p>The development of 'c' language was the result of revolution of several language . These were ALGOL (60),CPL,BCPL and B.<br>
                ALGOL 60 was amoduler and structured language but it did not succeed. The combined programming language (CPL) developed at cambridge university and <br>
                university of london in 1993. The basic combined programming language (BCPL) was very close to CPL, developed by MARTIN RECHARDS at Cambridge University in 1967.<br>
                The  'C' language had derived many features from the 'B' language . Developed by Ken Thompson at Bell Laboritries in 1998.<br>
                It was machine dependent for this reson Dennis Ritchi work an a new language as a succesor to 'B'. <br>
                The 'C' programming language by Dennis Ritchie come into existance in 1972, a Bell laboratories.<br>
                Due to the portable featureas of 'C' , application software. The 'c' language also surway as an intermediate language to empliment of a language<br>
                In 1983 the American National Standarad Institute (ANSI) established a cpmmities to provide a formal compressive defination of 'C'.<br>
                The (ANSI) stands known as "ANSI 'C'" was complited in 1988.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2><b>ðŸ‘‰Featureas Of 'c'</b></h2>
                <p>* The following are the featureas of 'C' language*</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p> 1) Follows the structured programming.<br>
                 2)Provides various operators such as arithmetic,increment,decrement and relational.<br>
                 3)Helps to develop efficient programes and system software.<br>
                 4)Allows manipulation of internal processor, register.<br>
                 5)Provides various data type Such as Int, Float and char.<br>
                 6)Allows the use of pointers to access memory.<br>
               <br>

               <h2><b>ðŸ‘‰Data Types</b></h2>
               <p>
                A data type defines the type of data is stored in a variable. The data in a variable can be of any type such as <br>
                Numaric, Character, and String. A data type determines how many bytes to be allocated to a variable , it also <br>
                determine permissible operation on a vriables. 'C' has some built in data type are also called basic or primary data types.<br>
                <b>1)Char.</b><br>
                <b>2)Integer.</b><br>
                <b>3)Floating(Real Point).</b><br>
                <b>4)Double.</b><br>
                <br>
                <h2><b>1)Char</b></h2>
                <p>The char data type is used to store the character type data. A char data type takes (1Byte) to store a variable .<br>
                It can store data i.e. either a character constant or a string constant. A character constant is a single character<br>
                enclosed within a pair of single coate's. <br>
                For example. 'A','b','@','N','n'<br>
                <br>
                <h2><b>2)Int </b></h2>
                <p>The Int data type is used to store whole numbers, which are a sets of non negative integer including Zero.<br>
                The rang for an int data type depends on the word length defined for a computer or (2 Bytes).<br>
                For example. 0,1,2,-------8,9 .<br>
                <br>
                <h2><b>3)Float</b></h2>
                <p>The float data type is used to store real numbers that have a single preciation Floating point numbers are numbers<br>
                    that contains a decimal point either to the lift or right interger. They are (4 Byte)mspace is allocate.<br>
                    <br></p>
                    <br>
                    <h2><b>4)Double</b></h2>
                    <p>The double data type is used to store real numbers that have a double preciation floating point. Preciation is <br>
                        related with the accuracy of data representing floating point number. A double data type value is similer to a <br>
                        normal float data type value. (8 Byte) space is allocated.<br> 

                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2><b>ðŸ‘‰Variables</b></h2>
                    <p>A variable is an entity whose values changes during the exicution of a programe. Variables are the names provided.<br>
                        to identify programming elements. A variable are used to identify a value, they are also called identifier.<br>
                        Variable also refers to a specific location, the memory where data can be stored easily. Each variable has a name <br>
                        and data type. All variable must their type indicated compiler can record, generate the appropriate code during<br>
                        translation and allocate the required space in the memory. Variable to represent constant function, arrays and <br>
